## h2 Heading

### h3 Heading

#### h4 Heading

##### h5 Heading

## Horizontal Rules

```js
const harry = spell(`lumos`)
```

Or something like:

```html
<div>Hello World</div>
```

Or maybe:

```css
.imperio {
  color: blue;
}
```

Live version:

```js react-live
const onClick = () => {
  alert("You opened me")
}
render(<button onClick={onClick}>Alohomora!</button>)
```

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

1) You can use sequential numbers...
1) ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++
}

console.log(foo(5))
```

Immutabality in javascript.

There are primitive types and reference type of data types in JavaScript.

Using immutability in our application solves a lot of issues like :-

\- Concurrency

\- Complexity

\- Shared mutable state

```javascript

var a = {name:'John',age:23}

var b = a;

b.name='Harry';

a;

{name: "Harry", age: 23}



let c = Object.assign({},a,{age:45});

c;

{name: "Harry", age: 45}

a;

{name: "Harry", age: 23}



```

Here c is created using a so it is not a reference to a. therefore any changes we make to c , won't affect a, but in the case of b, it is direct reference to the object a itself.

Another example

```javascript

var a ={name:"John", things:\[0,1,2]};

var b = Object.assign({},a,{name:"Fred"}); //creating a new object from a

b.things.push(3);

4

a.things;

(4) \[0, 1, 2, 3] //pushing anything to b.things is also getting reflected in a.things



//we can correct this using..

b.things = a.things.concat(3);

```

## Basics

Immutable data cannot be changes once created, leading to much simpler app development
Immutable.js package gives us many persistent immutable data structures

### Maps

Maps are unordered collection, just like objects with key-value pairs

```javascript
import Immutable from "immutable"
var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }) //creates a new object
var map2 = map1.set("b", 45)
console.log(map1.get("b"))
console.log(map2.get("b"))
//Here map1 object is not changed
map1.merge(map2)
```

### List

List is ordered collection similar to javascript array.
var list1 = Immutable.List([1,2,3,4]);
